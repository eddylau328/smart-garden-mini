# INA219_WE
An Arduino library for the INA219 current and power sensor module.

It allows to set various ADC modes, gains and bus voltage ranges. Continous mode, triggered mode, power down and ADC off mode are supported. 

I attached a list of public functions and a fritzing scheme for the example sketches.

You find further details here (only in German, sorry): https://wolles-elektronikkiste.de/ina219

Note: Version 1.1.2 corrected a misspelling of "continuous" which might lead to backwards incompatibilities. You might need to change your code.
